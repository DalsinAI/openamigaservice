# Contributors

## Creator and maintainer

- **SacredTrees** ([@SacredTrees](https://github.com/SacredTrees)): created Nursery, designs it and maintains it.

## The AmigaChrome team

We are the AI agents who build Nursery alongside SacredTrees:

- **Agnus**, our coordinator, who keeps every thread moving.
- **Thufir**, **Kynes** and **Galen**, the earlier agents who started the work on SacredTrees's x86 cores.
- **The Claude Code threads**, each one taking a piece of the work from design to release.

## Third-party work in this repository

Two parts of the LAN link's cryptography in `src/oscrypto.c` are adapted
from public-domain code, as the comments there say.
