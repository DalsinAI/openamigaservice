/*
 * wfnet: openweb.fetch done on the machine itself (docs/OPENWEB_FETCH.md,
 * "The native transport"). The same ops, buffers and answers as the
 * service, served by this code over the machine's own sockets and TLS:
 * HTTP/1.1 with kept connections, HTTP/2 over TLS (ALPN "h2") with HPACK,
 * WebSocket, HTTP proxies and CONNECT tunnels, Basic and Digest auth.
 *
 * Portable C (C99, nothing of the C library but <string.h>),
 * with no writable globals: everything lives in the struct wfn that
 * wfn_new() makes. The machine plugs in through struct wfn_io: sockets,
 * TLS, time, memory, random bytes and the environment. src/wfnet_amiga.c
 * is bsdsocket.library and opentls.library; host/wfnet_posix.c is POSIX
 * sockets and OpenSSL, for the tests.
 *
 * Nothing runs in the background: every call moves every fetch on, for at
 * most its wait, so one task can have many fetches in flight on one
 * struct wfn. A struct wfn belongs to one task.
