 * Each call is one request through openservice.device, which takes it to
 * the services card or a paired Cradle; or, when neither offers the
 * service (or WF_MODE_NATIVE asks for it), is answered here by the native
 * transport (src/wfnet*.c) over bsdsocket.library and opentls.library,
 * with the same messages. The waits are in milliseconds, at most 2000: a
 * call answers sooner when something happens.
 *
 * Many fetches from one task without blocking (docs/OPENWEB_FETCH.md, "One
 * task, many fetches"): start each HEAD, READ or WS_RECV with
 * wf_async_start(), sleep in wf_wait() on the service and the task's own
 * signals, and collect what is answered with wf_async_check(). On the card
 * each is a SendIO() answered later (the card holds it, wf_start); on the
 * native transport wf_wait() moves every fetch on.
